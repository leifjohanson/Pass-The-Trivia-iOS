### Answering a Question

Questions are presented in a multiple-choice format, so below the question there will be four different answer options. The question needs to be answered within a certain time period, or else the player will be marked as incorrect. Players are awarded points based on the correctness of their answer and the time it takes for them to answer. The layout for the questions can be seen below, with the question display screen before the question has been answered, the question display screen after the question has been answered correctly, and the question display screen after the question has been answered incorrectly.
